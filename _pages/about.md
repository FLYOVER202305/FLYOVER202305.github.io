The complexity of highways mainly lies in highway interchanges due to the diverse connection topology and ramp geometry, which significantly affect the decision-making and motion control of A Vs.

For example, different interchanges may contain a different number of one-way roads. Moreover, a ramp can leave or enter a road or another ramp from the left or right.

Comprehensive A V testing under diverse interchanges is challenging. First, it is risky, resourceconsuming, and even impossible to cover all interchanges in a city physically. On the other hand, even though simulationbased testing provides an efficient way to perform A V testing, it highly relies on HD maps. The lack of a ready-to-use dataset consisting of diverse highway intersections becomes the bottleneck.

To address this issue, we propose a systematic method to generate diverse interchanges with measurable diversity coverage.
