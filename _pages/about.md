Nanyang Technological University and Alibaba Self-driving Lab are collaborating on autonomous driving technology research. which aims to develop reliable, interpretable, and verifiable autonomous simulation data solutions. The current research directions are as follows:


Autonomous driving data mining and clustering


Simulation scenario modeling and generation


Safety scenario analysis and reconstruction


Fault injection and adversarial attacks


Accelerated longtail scenario generation


Interactive scenario generation


We sincerely welcome more scholars to join our research work .

——HD Map-based Functional Safety Testing of Autonomous vehicles

Scenario-based testing has been the de facto method for the functional safety verification of autonomous vehicles.

The term "scenario" is commonly defined as:


"... a quantitative description of the relevant characteristics and activities and/or goals of the ego vehicle(s), the static environment, the dynamic environment, and all events that are relevant to the ego vehicle(s) within the time interval between the first and the last relevant event."  (Gelder, E. D. et al. 2022).


A layered structure of scenario elements has been proposed as shown on the right.
