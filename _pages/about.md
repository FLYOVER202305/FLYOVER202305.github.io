ADST ( Autonomous Driving Simulation Test ) focuses on autonomous driving-related testing and simulation technologies.  Alibaba's Autonomous Driving Lab, Nanyang Technological University and Tianjin University are cooperating on autonomous driving technology research.  Aims to develop reliable, interpretable and verifiable autonomous simulation data solutions.  Current research directions are as follows:


* Autonomous driving data mining and clustering


* Simulation scenario modeling and generation


* Safety scenario analysis and reconstruction


* Fault injection and adversarial attacks


* Accelerated longtail scenario generation


* Interactive scenario generation


We sincerely welcome more scholars to join our research work .

ACADEMIC RESEARCH

* SOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE REARCH

——HD Map-based Functional Safety Testing of Autonomous vehicles

Scenario-based testing has been the de facto method for the functional safety verification of autonomous vehicles.

The term "scenario" is commonly defined as:


"... a quantitative description of the relevant characteristics and activities and/or goals of the ego vehicle(s), the static environment, the dynamic environment, and all events that are relevant to the ego vehicle(s) within the time interval between the first and the last relevant event."  (Gelder, E. D. et al. 2022).


A layered structure of scenario elements has been proposed as shown on the right.

From the layered model it can be seen that the road level (L1) and Traffic Infrastructures (L2) lays the foundation for scenario elements of higher levels (e.g. L3, L4). 

Hence, L1 and L2 (i.e. HD maps) are the basics for the scenario diversity and efficiency. 


However, it is resource-consuming to construct high quality HD maps, which are, as a result, often overlooked during test scenario construction.
* MORE REARCH

In collaboration with Nanyang Technological University and Alibaba Autonomous Driving Lab, we have conducted the following research aimed at filling the above gaps. An overview of the scene hierarchy model (Bagschik et al. 2018) and the last relevant event. (Gelder, ED, et al., 2022).
