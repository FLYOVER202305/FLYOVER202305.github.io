Nanyang Technological University and Alibaba Self-driving Lab are collaborating on autonomous driving technology research. which aims to develop reliable, interpretable, and verifiable autonomous simulation data solutions. The current research directions are as follows:


* Autonomous driving data mining and clustering


* Simulation scenario modeling and generation


* Safety scenario analysis and reconstruction


* Fault injection and adversarial attacks


* Accelerated longtail scenario generation


* Interactive scenario generation


We sincerely welcome more scholars to join our research work . 


TEAM INTRODUCTION
======

The Autopilot Lab is committed to researching the core technologies of autopilot, such as machine learning, integrated design of hardware and software, perception/decision planning/positioning, etc., so as to realize its productization, scale and commercialization, promote industrial reform with technological development, and carry the mission of empowering the important fields of national economy and people's livelihood such as logistics, transportation, safety, and municipal affairs with autopilot technology.

ACADEMIC RESEARCH
======

In collaboration with Nanyang Technological University and Alibaba Autonomous Driving Lab, we have conducted the following research aimed at filling the above gaps. An overview of the scene hierarchy model (Bagschik et al. 2018) and the last relevant event. (Gelder, ED, et al., 2022).

INDUSTRY INFLUENCE
======

* Professional competition

[High-speed autonomous driving algorithm race](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1752261226515303589&wfr=baike)：The Management Committee of Shanghai Jinqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone jointly launched the 2022 Global "Future Car" scene Innovation Challenge. Aiming at the high-speed autonomous driving scene, the "intelligent algorithm competition" was set up. The competition questions covered the typical tasks of other car merging, accident detour, low-speed vehicle detour, etc. The participating teams conducted algorithm training and testing based on the Dharma Institute simulation platform.
