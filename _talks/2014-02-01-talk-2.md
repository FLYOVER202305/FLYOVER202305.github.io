As mentioned earlier, each route contians two roads and one junction. 

We define the following features to classify the junctions:

has_traffic_light

has_stop_sign

has_incoming_crosswalk

has_outgoing_crosswalk

topology feature

The topolgy feature is denoted by the co nectivity of the connected roads and thus represents the direction of the traffic flow through the junction.  

The following diagram visualizes some of the topology features extracted from the San Francisco map. It can be seen that the topology feature not only records the traffic flow information but also implies the shape (i.e. geometry) of the junction.
